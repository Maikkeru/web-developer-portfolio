          the purpose of producing the net income/loss for a given period.

        <h3>A Dad Joke Generator</h3>
        <p>
          This Dad Joke Generator is a node.js app that produces a number of dad
          jokes at random, from a list of about 150 dad jokes. This app can be
          quickly added to a much larger application for supplying an asortment
          of corny jokes at your bidding.

        <p>
          This functions python project was something that I created during my
          time at NCSU. It started as a personal module to gather up all of my
          most used math functions in one spot. This module later evolved into a
          set of functions that I was willing to research and devlop from pure
          math into a series of functions that would allow me grapple with these
          math concepts in more detail.
